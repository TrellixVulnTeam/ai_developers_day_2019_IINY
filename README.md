# Welcome to NVIDIA AI Developers day!

This repository includes example usecases of SSD object detection inference.
TensorRT (Session1) and Transfer learning toolkit (Session2) will help you to optimize and quantize your network.
And Deepstream will be great framework for your Real-time Intelligent Video Analysis application.

- Session1 : TF model => TensorRT engine by using TensorRT
- Session2 : NGC model => TensorRT engine by Transfer Learning Toolkit
- Session3 : Deploy TensorRT engines from Session1 and 2 on Deepstream Pipeline
